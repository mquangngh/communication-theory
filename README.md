The purpose of the Matlab exercises is to gain further insight into the basic theories of signals and communication systems and to learn how to simulate, process and analyze communication signals and systems using Matlab
Exercise 1: topics include spectrum, FFT, filtering, sampling.
Exercise 2: topics include random variables and random signals.
Exercise 3: topics include pulse amplitude modulation, pulse shaping and eye diagram.
Exercise 4: topics include QAM, receiver processing for symbol detection, and timing/phase errors.
Exercise 5: topics include basic OFDM processing using IFFT/FFT and investigating how multipath channel impacts the received subcarrier samples.
